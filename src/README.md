# PV lookup table

This script generates a lookup table for a photovoltaic panel. The table is used to calculate the current and voltage of the panel at a given temperature and irradiance.

## Usage

Make sure to be in the same directory as the script and run it with Octave.

```bash
octave pv_lut.m
```

> A UNIX-like shell is required to run the script.

A CSV file will be generated in the `out` directory. The file contains the lookup table for the panel.

## Todo

- add calculation for b by comparing results with datasheet
- currents get negative with higher voltages
- Vmin, amin?
- TC_I, TC_V?
- adjust output to be compatible with non UNIX-like shells

# PV IV curve

This script generates the IV curve of a photovoltaic panel, given a CSV generated by the previous script. The current and power are extracted from the lookup table at maximum irradiance, 75% irradiance, and 50% irradiance.

## Usage

Make sure to be in the same directory as the script and run it with Octave. A lookup table as `out/pv_lut.csv` is required.

```bash
octave pv_iv.m
```

> A UNIX-like shell is required to run the script.

A PNG file will be generated in the `out` directory. The file contains the IV curve of the panel.

## Todo

- adjust input and output to be compatible with non UNIX-like shells
