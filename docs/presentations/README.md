# How to write a presentation

1. Copy the `template` directory and rename it to the name of your presentation (e.g. `meeting_3`).
1. Edit the source file `pres.tex` to write your presentation using the `beamer` class as shown in the comment. Don't forget to change the title and subtitle.
1. Compile the source file using the `Makefile` by running `make` in the terminal. The output will be in the `assets/presentations` directory.
